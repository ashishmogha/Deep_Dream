# Deep_Dream

**DeepDream** is a computer vision program created by Google which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia, thus creating a dream-like hallucinogenic appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.

Google's program popularized the term (deep) **dreaming** to refer to the generation of images that produce desired activations in a trained deep network, and the term now refers to a collection of related approaches.

# Usage

* The dreaming idea can be applied to hidden (internal) neurons other than those in the output, which allows exploration of the roles and representations of various parts of the network.

* It is also possible to optimize the input to satisfy either a single neuron (this usage is sometimes called Activity Maximization) or an entire layer of neurons.

*  While **dreaming** is most often used for visualizing networks or producing computer art, it has recently been proposed that adding "dreamed" inputs to the training set can improve training times.


# Requirements

This code is written in python language and using tensorflow backend.
* Requirements are as follows:

* **Keras**: Deep Learning library for Theano and TensorFlow.
  Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. 
  
* **SciPy** is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. 

* In particular, these are some of the core packages: **Numpy,Matplotlib,pandas** etc.
